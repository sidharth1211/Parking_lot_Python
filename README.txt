Steps to run program on Anaconda shell
1) OPEN THE SHELL IN THE SAMPLE DIRECTORY
2) RUN THE COMMAND python core.py <input.txt> output.txt
3) I've also added comments to my code for better understanding


helper.py: Contains all the definition of classes and functions

core.py: main file which calls all the function, reads input from input.txt and writes to output.txt

Constants.py: contains indentifiers for commands

parkinLot.py: contains the ParkingLot class

car.py: contains the Class

input.txt: contains input for the problem 

output.txt : contains output for problem
